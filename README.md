## USB-NeXT-Keyboard
Turn your non-ADB NeXT keyboard into a USB keyboard with an Arduino Micro!

The accompanying tutorial is available at https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-next-keyboard-with-arduino-micro/

Requires an Arduino Micro for the USB portion - but could be ported to another micro fairly easily
